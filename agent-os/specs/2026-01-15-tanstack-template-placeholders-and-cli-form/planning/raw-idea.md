# Raw Idea

I now want to create a new spec that will update the tanstack start template repo with comment strings to be replaced by the tanstack framework installer. I also want this spec to implement any missing methods required in the tanstack framework installer. lastly, I need this spec to update the cli form to properly take in all of the necessary inputs from the user about their project, including select oauth providers, as well as email and password (this will update a single string in the better auth config index file via a comment string that must be added), whether to create a github repo or not, and whatever else is defined in this current project scope.

## Key Points

1. Add comment string placeholders to TanStack Start template files
2. Implement missing methods in TanStack framework installer
3. Update CLI form to collect all necessary user inputs:
   - OAuth provider selection
   - Email and password authentication option
   - GitHub repository creation
   - Other project options
4. Better Auth config updates via comment string replacement
