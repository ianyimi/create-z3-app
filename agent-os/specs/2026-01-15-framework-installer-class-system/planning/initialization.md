# Spec Initialization

## Spec Name
Framework Installer Class System

## Initial Description
I want to build the FrameworkInstaller class that will be the base class for which various child classes will be created that inherit this class for each framework. the class needs methods that will perform the necessary string replacements in various files based on the framework. the we will need to go back and forth to determine all required methods in order for the installation to complete successfully. ideally, the cli should only have to call the initProject method on the frameworkInstaller class that will take in the options returned from the input form and successfully run all string replacement functions in order to setup the project completely for the user based on their options. upon installation it will follow this pattern, the base folder will be copied to the target location, then the frameworkInstallers would have updated all necessary files with comment replacement strings based on the input options from the user. for example, here are some functions that will be necessary on the framework installer class and also the framework input survey: there will need to be a question asking the user which oauth providers they want to allow users to signin their project with: they will be able to select from the list of all providers that better auth supports. to handle these choices, the installer class will need to have methods to update the better auth config as well as the env.example file. I only want the functions defined in the class as abstract functions. there can be a non abstract function for updating the env.example file that will append to the end of the file the text passed into the method. there will also need to be abstract methods that update the oauth config by replacing all applicable better auth and better auth ui files based on the framework using this same input. there will need to be another question asking the user if they have a tweakcn link or css file from the tweakcn website for setting a custom theme. each framework may need separete functions for this, but again, all function definitions should be empty for this spec, without any actual implementations. this is just for planning out the class and what methods are required. there will likely need to be another question asking the user if they want to create a github repo, which will require a method to make this happen in the installer class as well per framework. we'll need another question asking if the user wants to install dependencies, which will call a util function to run the install command based on the runtime used to run the create command (either pnpm create z3 my-app, npm create my-app, yarn create z3 my-app, bun create z3 my-app) ask me more questions if there may be some questions and methods I am forgetting
