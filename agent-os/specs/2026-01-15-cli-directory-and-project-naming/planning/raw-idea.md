# Raw Idea

The user wants to update the CLI so that it will:
1. Create a new directory in the location where the command was run using the name argument if passed
2. Ask the user what their project is called first (before the framework selection) if the user does not specify a project folder name in the command
3. If we need to create an empty nextjs template folder to use since we already have the tanstack template base there, then that must be done as well

The user states "I have everything working to this point" and "this is all I want to happen for this spec."

This is an update to an existing CLI tool for project scaffolding.
