# Next.js Template - Placeholder

This is a placeholder template for Next.js projects in the Z3 Stack CLI.

## Status

This template is currently a minimal placeholder structure. The full Next.js template with Convex, Better Auth, and shadcn/ui integration will be implemented in a future specification.

## Current Structure

- `package.json` - Minimal Next.js dependencies with project name placeholder
- `.gitignore` - Standard Next.js ignore patterns
- `src/` - Empty source directory (placeholder)

## Future Implementation

The complete Next.js template will include:
- Full Convex integration and schema
- Better Auth setup with OAuth providers
- shadcn/ui components
- TypeScript configuration
- Tailwind CSS setup
- App Router structure
- Environment configuration

For now, this structure serves as a placeholder to support Next.js selection in the CLI framework prompts.
